INTRO: This application was written in 2021 and won't run directly on python 3.10.x. The build tools
have change and some of the dependencies won't install. I recommend running as a docker container 
running python 3.8.x, as I can't be sure that the dependencies can be updated without fixing the 
vulnerabilities.
PREREQUESITES: docker
